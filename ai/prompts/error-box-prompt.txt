You are given:
1. A list of text and bounding boxes extracted from Azure Document Intelligence.
2. A list of error messages, each with a unique error ID and the specific text that caused the error.

Each bounding box contains text that was identified on a document, along with its bounding box coordinates.

Each error includes a unique ID and the text snippet that triggered the error.

Your task:
Match each error's text with the corresponding text in the bounding boxes (exact or approximate match), and return a JSON object where each key is the error ID and the value is the bounding box associated with the error.

### Input

Bounding Boxes:
[
  {"text": "Name: John Doe", "boundingBox": [x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4]},
  {"text": "Date of Birth: 01/01/1990", "boundingBox": [x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4]},
  ...
]

Errors:
[
  {"id": "E001", "text": "John Doe"},
  {"id": "E002", "text": "01/01/1990"},
  ...
]

### Output

Return only a JSON in the following format:
{
  "E001": [x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4],
  "E002": [x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4],
  ...
}
If an errorâ€™s text is not found in any bounding box, omit it from the output.
